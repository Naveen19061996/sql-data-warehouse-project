üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

![data_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27827996-4cea-48af-89e5-5d7c1b028e4b)

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
